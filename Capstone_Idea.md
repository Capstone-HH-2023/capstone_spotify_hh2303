Spotify 

netflix ("Stranger Things", "Casa de Papel", "Bridgerton", "Squid Game") was very successfull with in-house productions, so Spotify decided to do the same

want 2(4) testmarkets in different regions (tbd) to see, what kind of music they should produce/publish in that specific region

focus is just on the music/style - popularity, not on profit/return of invest (some other guys handling that... :p)
Popularity: high charts position (high stream count garantied)

Want us to tell them, what KPIs the should look at and therefor then producing music
Maybe with whom to collaborate(?)
